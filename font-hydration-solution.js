The solution focuses on ensuring the font files are correctly served and cached.  This may involve several approaches:

1. **Verify Font File Paths:** Double-check that the paths to your font files in the `next/font` configuration are accurate and accessible. 
2. **Caching:** Implement appropriate caching mechanisms (e.g., using `Cache-Control` headers) to avoid unnecessary reloads of the font files. 
3. **Optimized Imports:** Consider using `variable` fonts or other optimization strategies to reduce the font file size and improve load times.
4. **Font Loading Libraries:** As a last resort, if `next/font`'s `static` import proves troublesome, explore using a different font loading library that offers better control over client-side font rendering and hydration.
